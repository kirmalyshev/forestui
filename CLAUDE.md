# CLAUDE.md - AI Development Guidelines

This file provides context for AI assistants (like Claude) working on forestui.

## Project Overview

forestui is a terminal UI for managing Git worktrees, built with Rust and
ratatui. It runs inside tmux and gives developers one place to manage many
worktrees, their editors, their terminals, and their Claude Code sessions.

It was a Python/Textual application through v0.9.x. The rewrite is in
`doc/rust-rewrite/` — spec, architecture, migration plan, and the `tu`-driven
acceptance playbook.

## Tech Stack

- **Rust 1.88+**, edition 2024
- **ratatui 0.30** for the TUI, **crossterm 0.29** (re-exported as `ratatui::crossterm`)
- **tokio** for background work and subprocesses
- **serde / serde_json** for the two JSON config files
- **clap** (derive) for the CLI

Git and tmux are driven by shelling out to the real binaries, not through
bindings. That keeps the argv identical to the Python build and avoids a
libgit2 build dependency.

## Development Commands

```bash
make lint         # cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
make typecheck    # cargo check --all-targets
make format-check # cargo fmt --check
make test         # cargo test
make check        # all of the above
make format       # cargo fmt
make run          # cargo run
make clean        # cargo clean
```

Always run `make check` before committing changes.

## Code Conventions

### Rust
- Edition 2024. Prefer let-chains (`if let Some(x) = ... && cond`) over nesting.
- No `unwrap()` or `expect()` on anything that can fail at runtime. Config
  parsing, subprocess spawning, and filesystem access all degrade gracefully —
  a corrupt config file must never block startup.
- Errors that reach the user become a notification, not a panic.
- Colours come from `theme.rs`. Never hardcode a `Color::Rgb` in a UI module.
- Comments explain *why*, not *what*.

### Immediate-mode UI
ratatui redraws the whole frame every event; there are no persistent widget
objects and no CSS. Two consequences shape the code:

1. **Focus is an index, not a widget.** `App::detail_items()` returns the
   ordered list of focusable controls in the detail pane, and `app.detail_index`
   points into it. **`ui/detail.rs` must render items in exactly that order.**
   If the two drift, Enter fires the wrong action. Any change to one requires
   the matching change to the other, and the test asserting the counts match
   must stay green.
2. **Layout is `Layout`/`Constraint`, not stylesheets.** Sizes are computed per
   frame; nothing is "auto height".
3. **Mouse support is manual.** There is no widget tree to hit-test against, so
   every frame the renderers record the rectangle of each clickable thing via
   `App::push_hit(rect, HitTarget::…)`, and `App::handle_mouse` resolves a click
   against that list (last recorded wins, so a modal takes clicks from the panes
   it covers). A control that is drawn but never recorded is dead to the mouse —
   that was a real regression: the first Rust build enabled no mouse capture at
   all and every click did nothing. `main.rs` must keep `EnableMouseCapture`.

Controls are drawn with `ui::button()`, which renders a filled pill with rounded
half-block caps so they read as buttons rather than plain labels. Use
`ui::button_width()` for the rectangle you record, so the hit region matches
what was drawn.

### Async and the event loop
Everything funnels through one `mpsc::UnboundedReceiver<AppEvent>` in
`event.rs`. Terminal input arrives from a blocking reader thread; background
work arrives from `tokio::spawn`.

**Never block the event loop.** For any operation that may take time (git, gh,
scanning session files):
1. Render immediately with a loading state (`app.sessions` / `app.issues` are
   `Option`, where `None` means "still loading").
2. `tokio::spawn` the work with a cloned `EventTx`.
3. Send an `AppEvent` when it completes; `App::handle_event` folds it into state.

Late results must be discarded when the selection has moved on — compare the
event's `path` against the current one before applying it.

### Services
Services are free functions in modules, not singletons. Shared caches (the
GitHub issue cache, the auth status) live behind a `OnceLock<Mutex<...>>` inside
the module that owns them.

## Key Design Decisions

### tmux Requirement
forestui requires tmux and re-executes itself into a tmux session when started
outside one. This enables TUI editors in tmux windows, session persistence, and
fast switching between editor, app, and Claude windows.

The re-exec uses `std::env::current_exe()`, so a `cargo run` build re-launches
itself rather than whatever `forestui` happens to be on `PATH`.

### Multi-Forest Support
The forest directory is a CLI argument, not a setting:

```bash
forestui ~/forest      # default
forestui ~/work        # different forest
```

Each forest has its own `.forestui-config.json` state file.

### Config Compatibility
`.forestui-config.json` and `~/.config/forestui/settings.json` keep the exact
filenames and JSON schemas the Python build used, so a user can move between
builds without losing state. Every field is `#[serde(default)]` so partial and
older files load cleanly. **Do not rename or restructure these fields.**

### Coexistence with forest (macOS)
- forestui uses `.forestui-config.json`
- forest uses `.forest-config.json`
- Both can share the same `~/forest` directory safely

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Service
1. Create `src/services/myservice.rs`
2. Add `pub mod myservice;` to `src/services/mod.rs`
3. Expose free functions; keep any shared state in a module-private `OnceLock`

### Adding a Detail-Pane Action
1. Add a variant to `Action` in `src/app.rs`
2. Emit it from `App::detail_items()` at the right position
3. Render it in `src/ui/detail.rs` at the **same** position
4. Handle it in `App::run_action`
5. Update the test asserting rendered-item count equals `detail_items().len()`

### Adding a Modal
1. Add the state struct and its `handle_key` to `src/modal.rs`, documenting the
   meaning of each focus index
2. Add a variant to the `Modal` enum and wire it into `handle_key` / `tick`
3. Render it in `src/ui/modals.rs`
4. If it returns a value, add a `ModalResult` variant and handle it in
   `App::apply_modal_result`

### Adding a New CLI Option
1. Add the field to `Args` in `src/cli.rs`
2. Carry it through `self_command` so the tmux re-exec preserves it
3. Handle it in `main`

### Modifying Settings
1. Update `Settings` in `src/models.rs` (keep `#[serde(default)]`)
2. Update `SettingsModal` in `src/modal.rs` and its rendering in `src/ui/modals.rs`
3. Settings are persisted to `~/.config/forestui/settings.json`

## Testing

Unit tests live beside the code in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` and run with
`make test`. Async code uses `#[tokio::test]`. Rendering is tested against
`ratatui::backend::TestBackend`, which renders into an in-memory buffer you can
assert on.

**Visual/behavioural verification:** forestui is a TUI app — lint, typecheck and
unit tests alone cannot catch visual bugs, wrong window names, broken
interactions, or UI regressions. Use the `test-forestui` skill to drive forestui
in a headless terminal with `tu` and verify the change works. Do this
proactively, not only when asked.

`doc/rust-rewrite/TU_USECASES.md` is the acceptance playbook: 77 numbered
scenarios with exact keystrokes and expected output. The P0 cases are the
regression suite — run the relevant ones after any behavioural change.

UC-53–70 are automated. Capture a build and compare two builds with:

```bash
scripts/tu-sweep.sh rust ./target/release/forestui
scripts/tu-compare.sh rust python
scripts/tu-composite.sh rust python   # side-by-side PNGs, one per case
```

Compare the Python build against the **installed release** (`uv tool install
forestui`, currently 1.3.0), not a source checkout — that is the build users
actually ran, and it is the reference the frames are diffed against.

Each case writes a normalised text frame to
`doc/rust-rewrite/baseline/<build>/` (committed — this is the diffable
baseline) and a PNG to `doc/rust-rewrite/screenshots/<build>/` (gitignored,
for eyeballing colour and focus). After a UI change, re-run the sweep and
review the frame diff: an unexpected change there is a regression, an expected
one needs the baseline refreshed in the same commit.

**Text frames alone are not enough.** Colour, focus rings and selection
highlights exist only in the pixels — a button that lost its accent renders an
identical frame. `tu-composite.sh` pairs the two builds' PNGs per case so those
differences are visible rather than inferred; read the composites after any
change to `theme.rs` or a renderer.

A sweep that does not exercise a section will happily report parity for it.
UC-96 guards against that specifically: it captures the repository pane at full
height and asserts that sessions and issues actually rendered and that no
section fell back to its empty state. Keep that guard honest when adding cases.

The harness waits on screen conditions, never fixed sleeps — Textual repaints
far slower than ratatui, and fixed sleeps produced false mismatches. Anything
added to the sweep must use `await <regex>`.

Note that `ensure_tmux` re-executes the binary, so for `tu` runs you must build
first (`cargo build`) and point `$FUI_CMD` at `target/debug/forestui`.

## Versioning

Version is `0.0.0` in source (`Cargo.toml` and `cli::VERSION`). Real versions
are derived from git tags at release time by the release workflow.

Running from source shows version `0.0.0` and auto-enables dev mode, which gives
the tmux window a timestamped name (`forestui-dev-HHMM`) so a dev instance never
collides with a real one.

### Development

1. Create a branch, make changes
2. **Always run `make check` before committing, pushing, or opening a PR.** Do
   not push code that fails formatting, clippy, or tests — fix issues first.
3. Open a PR and merge to `main`

### Releasing

```bash
gh release create v0.10.0 --generate-notes
```

This triggers the release workflow, which stamps the version from the tag,
builds binaries for macOS (arm64, x86_64) and Linux (x86_64), attaches them to
the release, and publishes to crates.io.
